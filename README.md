## FAQs

<details>
<summary>What's the difference with shadcn_flutter</summary>
My repo was created the 05/01/2024 while he started the 12/02/2024. He never contacted me to contribute.
It's an open source project, I'd love to have contributions.

Each widget I make takes some time because I try to solve problems in a simple way, making each widget extremely customizable.

Another library could probably come first with more widgets, but in the long run it's the quality the most important thing.
