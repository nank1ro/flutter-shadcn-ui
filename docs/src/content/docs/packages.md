## Packages included in the library

Flutter Shadcn UI consists of fantastic open-source libraries that are exported and you can use them without importing them into your project.

### [flutter_animate](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_animate)

The flutter animate library is a very cool animations library extensively used in Shadcn UI Components.

With flutter_animate animations can be easily customized from the user, because components will take a `List<Effect>`.
