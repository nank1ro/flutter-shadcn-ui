## Packages included in the library

Flutter Shadcn UI consists of fantastic open-source libraries that are exported and you can use them without importing them into your project.

### [flutter_animate](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_animate)

The flutter animate library is a very cool animations library extensively used in Shadcn UI Components.

With flutter_animate animations can be easily customized from the user, because components will take a `List<Effect>`.

### [lucide_icons_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/lucide_icons_flutter)

A nice icon library that is used in Shadcn UI Components.
You can use Lucide icons with the `LucideIcons` class, for example `LucideIcons.activity`.
