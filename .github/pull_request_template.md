## Pre-launch Checklist

- [ ] I read the [Contributor Guide] and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs.
- [ ] I read and followed the [Flutter Style Guide].
- [ ] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above.
- [ ] I updated/added relevant documentation (doc comments with `///`).
- [ ] I added new tests to check the change I am making.
- [ ] I followed the [Data Driven Fixes] where supported.
- [ ] All existing and new tests are passing.
- [ ] I bumped the package version following the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) guidelines (For now the major is the second number and the minor the third, because the package is not feature complete). For example, if the package is at version `0.18.0` and you introduced a breaking change or a new feature, bump it to `0.19.0`, if you just added a fix or a chore bump it to `0.18.1`.
- [ ] I updated the `CHANGELOG.md` file with a summary of changes made following the format already used.
